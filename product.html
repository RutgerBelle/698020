					What is a sleep tracker?
				</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>A sleep tracker</strong> is a small device, for example like a watch, that you wear while you are sleeping. While you are asleep the sleep tracker measures things like your heartbeat and breathing. Your sleep quality and quantity gets measured with an ‘’accelerometer”. An accelerometer is a small detector that notices how much movement you make in your sleep, based on this it estimates your sleep time and quality. There also other sleep study’s that delve even further into this subject by the oxygen levels in your blood and recording brain waves.

				<h3>
					What problem does a sleep tracker solve?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Sleeping is very important as it keeps us focused and giving us rest, but if you don’t sleep long enough or can’t get enough quality sleep, tracking your sleep might be a good idea. A sleep tracker solves a lot of problems, by getting the data that is processed while you are asleep you get a good look in to your sleep quality and quantity. This can help you visualizing the problem of your fatigue. 
				</p>

			<article id = "article3">
				<h3>
					How do you use a sleep tracker?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Although the technique about sleep tracking is difficult, using a sleep tracker is not really that difficult. What you need is a sleep tracker like a watch and a software program that can show you the results of you night’s sleep. Before you go to sleep you wear your watch, thereafter you go to sleep and finally you wake up	 and you can see the results of your sleep on the program. Based on these result you can see where the underlying problem is of your daytime fatigue.

				<h3>
					Who is using sleep trackers?
				</h3>
				<p>
					As sleep is a very important part of your routine, we sleep a third of our lives on average(!), a lot of people already use a sleep tracker. Most of these people are people who focus on lifestyle and self improvement or people who have jobs where it is important to always perform on their best like athletes. Besides a lot of athletes also celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Kim Kardashian. Kim Kardashian even has her own sleep tracker app called “Oura ring”, a ring that measures our sleep.

				<h3>
					What can we expect from company’s delivering this service?
				</h3>
				<p>
					The minimum of what we can expect of company’s delivering sleep trackers like Oura Ring are devices with good quality and reliable results, although that’s easier said than done. Tracking the sleep accurately is very difficult as it’s not easy for the software to determine if you are asleep or not. You can lay down and watch you favorite Netflix show on an even keel and the software connected with your sleep tracker can think you might be sleeping.
				</p>

				<h3>
					What can the future bring us?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Sleep trackers are relatively new to the market and companies are still trying new ways. The future of sleep trackers is an unpredictable one, there are a lot of company competing with each other about a monopoly position in the market of sleep trackers. That is why I expect that companies who sell sleep trackers will invest money and time in studies about sleep tracking in order to get more accurate results and improvements in the quality, design and functionality of the devices.
