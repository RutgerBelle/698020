						The VAR, also called the Video Assistant Referee, is an assistant referee in football which is used off the field. The var uses camera’s on different angels to help the referee on the field making the accurate decision in a football match, communicating through an earphone. The VAR is used in various large and small tournaments and competitions around the world. The purpose of the VAR is to make football matches more fair and to solve and prevents mistakes made by the referee from happening.

						Neuroscience is about the nervous system, i.e. how it develops, it’s structure and what it does and why it does that, this is meant to improve performances during the game of athletes. Scientific models are used to collect data about motivation, stress and focus. Technologies such as visual attention help athletes to get a better sight of their unconscious mind. This collected data, combined with mental training, enables the opportunity to develop programs and to get the best result of the athlete performance and avoiding mental exhaustion.

						What is sleep tracking? <strong>Sleep tracking</strong> is monitoring your sleep trough sleep trackers, sleep trackers are devices like watches that measure everything that is important about your sleep, that is for example your sleep quality and the length of how long you slept. Sleeping is of course very important for athletes. A bad night’s sleep that is not long enough or of bad quality can lead to bad performance because of a slower response time-out, a less focused athlete and a lack of rest for the muscles. A good night’s sleep is not only important for athletes but for everybody.
